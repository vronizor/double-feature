# Roadmap

**The live view. Start here.** What is being worked on now, and what is decided
but not built. Nothing here is finished — the moment something ships it moves to
`HISTORY.md`, so this file stays the size of the work in front of you.

Three states, and only three. A fourth would be one person handing work to
themselves.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🗣 **open** | A decision is owed. **Do not build it.** The question is stated in the row |
| ⏳ **ready** | Decided. Anyone can pick it up from what is written here **without asking another question** — if a row is ⏳ and its section ends in a question, the row is lying |
| 🔨 **doing** | In progress right now. Three at most |

## v6

| Item | State | Where it stands |
|---|---|---|
| A design pass with Impeccable | 🔨 doing | **Detector run 2026-08-02 against the live app.** Across three rendered states plus a control that proved the scanner worked, the whole UI produced ONE actionable finding — the modal carried both a 1px border and a 24px shadow, now fixed by dropping the border. `overused-font` is a false positive: our stack is the standard system one and only reaches Roboto under headless Chrome. It said **nothing** about the Pool setup panel's density, which is what prompted this. `/polish` is ruled out — no dry-run, and scoping is whole-file, which here is the entire stylesheet. **Now running `critique`, the read-only design-review half**, which is a skill rather than a CLI command |

Deferred, so they are not re-proposed early: **Unscheduled** — cultness,
household memory, nominees as well as winners, box office beyond
France/Spain/US, where the database lives, and a LICENSE. All in `BACKLOG.md`.
Letterboxd is not deferred but **closed** — an explicit published refusal, not a
"not yet".

### 1. Traps carried into v6

Read `DECISIONS.md` §3 first. Three now, because v5 added one:

- **A source can answer successfully with less than it has.** Locale-gated
  data, pagination that re-serves page 1, an export with the right MIME type
  and no data in it. Check that a 200 carries what it should.
- **A guard sits downstream of the number it checks.** A match-rate floor
  cannot see that the matched films are the wrong ones. Inspect values, not
  just volumes — every real failure in v4 was found by a count that did not add
  up, never by a threshold.
- **A source can also answer with MORE than you asked for, in a shape that
  fits.** v5's US pages carried two annual tables measuring different things,
  and taking whichever parsed produced a list that was calendar-year before
  1982 and release-year after — plausible everywhere, coherent nowhere. When a
  page offers two tables, the question is not which parses but which one
  answers the question the list is asking.
